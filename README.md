# Plan Northwestern

**Plan Northwestern** is a website to help Northwestern students plan out their years of courses at the university. Find more information and get started at [https://plan-nu.com](https://plan-nu.com).

## Development

Development takes place on [dev](https://github.com/dilanx/plan-northwestern/tree/dev). I'll regularly commit there as I'm updating the tool (but the changes won't be active). Once a release is ready, dev will be merged onto [main](https://github.com/dilanx/plan-northwestern/tree/main) and [tagged](https://github.com/dilanx/plan-northwestern/tags). The project will be built and served immediately at release. The main branch should always have the code for the version of the site that's currently active.

This project is completely open-source. While redistributing the project is not allowed, you're welcome to submit issues with feature requests, or potentially create them yourself and submit a pull request. Contact me if you have any questions or are interested in how Plan Northwestern was developed.
