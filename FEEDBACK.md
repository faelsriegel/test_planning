# Plan Northwestern Feedback

Encounter a bug while using Plan Northwestern? Find any errors in course data? Have a suggestion for a new feature, user interface change, or anything? Let me know! I enjoy working on this project and would love to improve it.

By clicking the [issues](https://github.com/dilanx/plan-northwestern/issues?q=) tab above and creating a new issue, you can share your bug report or feature request (and attach any images as necessary). It'll help keep things organized, other people can see what feedback has been left already and upvote as necessary, I can follow up with any extra questions I have, and I can link updates I make to the code to the issue. You'll be able to stay updated on my progress!
